# Part A

## Create a database
```{r defineconnection}
# we will use the name of this variable to 
# set up sql output in the rmd file
my_connection <- RSQLite::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),"PartA_Hotel_Database.db")
```

* Before we start we can set a few options on the sqlite command line 
```{sql, eval=FALSE, connection=my_connection}
.headers on 
.mode column 
```


## Specifying the tables with DDL Queries

* Create tables for the database
* Set up data types and key constraints
* Assign AUTOINCREMENT to Primary Keys to generate unique numbers automatically 

### Guest table

* Information about each guest of all the hotels is tracked historically
* Hotel guest is anyone who used any service at a hotel (either accommodation or additional services)

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Guests
CREATE TABLE 'Guest'(
  'GuestID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  'FirstName' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'MiddleName' VARCHAR(30),
  'LastName' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'StreetNumber' INTEGER,
  'StreetName' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'City' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'State' VARCHAR(30),
  'PostalCode' VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  'Country' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'Email' VARCHAR(100),
  'HomePhone' INTEGER,
  'WorkPhone' INTEGER,
  'CellPhone' INTEGER
);
```

### Hotel table

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Hotel
CREATE TABLE 'Hotel'(
  'HotelID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  'HotelName' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'StreetNumber' INTEGER,
  'StreetName' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'City' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'State' VARCHAR(30),
  'PostalCode' VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  'Country' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'WebAddress' VARCHAR(100),
  'PrimaryPhone' INTEGER
);
```

### Channel Provider table

* Channel Providers charge a booking fee for each reservation
* This booking fee is fixed by channel provider and doesn't vary by hotel

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Channel Provider
CREATE TABLE 'ChannelProvider'(
  'ChannelProviderID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  'ChannelProviderName' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'Website' VARCHAR(200),
  'BookingFeeRate' DOUBLE NOT NULL
);
```

### Room table

* Room ID represents the room number
* Floor 1-5 are considered to be Low
* Floors > 5 are considered to be High
* Room Rates are fixed in this database, the seasonal costs are handled by another software

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Room
CREATE TABLE 'Room'(
  'RoomID' VARCHAR(30),
  'HotelID' INTEGER,
  'Floor' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'HighOrLow' VARCHAR(10),
  'NumberOfBeds' INTEGER DEFAULT 2,
  'SmokingAllowed' BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  'RoomFee' INTEGER NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY ('RoomID', 'HotelID'),
FOREIGN KEY ('HotelID') 
  REFERENCES Hotel('HotelID')
);
```

### Service Table

* The Service table stores accommodation as well as additional services
* Additional services include phone charging equipment rental, the use of hotel facilities, etc.
* The available hotel facilities vary based on the hotel
* At the hotel restaurant and bar reservations are mandatory, no walk-ins allowed
* Thus, all new guests should contact the hotel and leave their personal details first
* Costs of items on the restaurant's and bar's menu as well as equipment and 
  other hotel facilities rentals. Another software provides these costs to our database
 

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Service
CREATE TABLE 'Service'(
  'ServiceID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  'ServiceName' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'HotelID' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY ('HotelID') 
    REFERENCES Hotel('HotelID')
);
```

### Reservation table

* A guest might make multiple reservations
* A guest receives a separate ReservationID for each additional room he/she books

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Reservation
CREATE TABLE 'Reservation'(
  'ReservationID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  'HotelID' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'GuestID' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'RoomID' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'ChannelProviderID' INTEGER,
  'CreditCardNumber' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'CardExpireYear' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'CardExpireMonth' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'DateFrom' DATE NOT NULL,
  'DateTo' DATE NOT NULL,
  'SmokingPreference' BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  'NumberOfBeds' INTEGER,
  'NumberOfGuests' INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY ('GuestID') 
    REFERENCES Guest('GuestID'),
  FOREIGN KEY ('RoomID','HotelID') 
    REFERENCES Room('RoomID','HotelID'),
  FOREIGN KEY ('ChannelProviderID') 
    REFERENCES ChannelProvider('ChannelProviderID'),
  CHECK(CreditCardNumber BETWEEN 0 AND 9999999999999999),
  CHECK(CardExpireYear BETWEEN 20 AND 50),
  CHECK(CardExpireMonth BETWEEN 1 AND 12)
);
```

### Past Reservation table

* Reservation is removed from the Reservation table after it has been used
* It is considered used when either a guests check in or cancels his/her reservation
* Information on these reservations is stored in the Past Reservation table

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Past Reservations
CREATE TABLE 'PastReservation'(
  'PastReservationID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  'HotelID' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'GuestID' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'RoomID' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'DateFrom' DATE NOT NULL,
  'DateTo' DATE NOT NULL, 
  'PastReservationStatus' VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  'ChannelProviderID' INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY ('GuestID') 
    REFERENCES Guest('GuestID'),
  FOREIGN KEY ('RoomID','HotelID') 
    REFERENCES Room('RoomID','HotelID'),
  FOREIGN KEY ('ChannelProviderID') 
    REFERENCES ChannelProvider('ChannelProviderID')
);
```

### Room Status table

* Tracks the rooms status across all hotels
* The information in this table is used to calculate Number Of Available Rooms for Channel Providers
* Each hotel provider requires at least two rooms to be available for booking at any time
* We are tracking number of rooms available at each hotel daily since the current date and onward
* Available rooms are all rooms which are not reserved during a specific period of time
* Another software processes the information in the given table and sends it to the channel providers
* On a provider's website, when a user is searching for a room during a specific period 
  and if there are less than 2 rooms available for booking at a particular hotel,
  this hotel is not displayed in the search results on the provider's website. 

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Room Status
CREATE TABLE 'RoomStatus'(
  'RoomStatusID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  'RoomStatus' BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  'RoomID' VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  'HotelID' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'rsDate' DATE NOT NULL,
  'ReservationID' INTEGER,
  'PastReservationID' INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY ('RoomID', 'HotelID') 
    REFERENCES Room('RoomID', 'HotelID'),
  FOREIGN KEY ('PastReservationID')
    REFERENCES PastReservation('PastReservationID'),
  FOREIGN KEY ('ReservationID')
    REFERENCES Reservation('ReservationID')
  UNIQUE(HotelID, RoomID, rsDate)
);
```


### Invoice table

* An invoice is considered paid if outstanding amount is Â£0.00
* PaidFlag shows whether an invoice was paid in full (PaidFlag = TRUE/FALSE)
* DateFrom indicates the date when the first charge was made for a particular stay
* InvoiceCheckOutTime is assigned when all charges are paid in full by a guest and after he/she checks out
* Amount Outstanding is updated immediately right after any payment or charge is issued

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Invoice
CREATE TABLE 'Invoice'(
  'InvoiceID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  'GuestID' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'AmountOutstanding' INTEGER,
  'PaidFlag' BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  'DateFrom' DATETIME NOT NULL,
  'InvoiceCheckOutTime' DATETIME,
  FOREIGN KEY ('GuestID') 
    REFERENCES Guest('GuestID')
);
```

### Charge table

* A guest can book a room and use additional services provided by a hotel
* Accommodation fees as well as additional costs are stored as Charges
* Charges are reflected by each guest during his/her particular stay 

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Charge
CREATE TABLE 'Charge'(
  'ChargeID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  'GuestID' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'ServiceID' INTEGER NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY ('GuestID') 
    REFERENCES Guest('GuestID'),
  FOREIGN KEY ('ServiceID') 
    REFERENCES Service('ServiceID'),
  FOREIGN KEY ('InvoiceID') 
    REFERENCES Invoice('InvoiceID')
);
```

### Payment table

* A guest may pay his/her bill at any given time during a particular stay
* A guest might make multiple payments of any amounts
* A wide variety of payment types are accepted (credit card. check, cash, etc) 
* Different payment types are stored as PaymentType 

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- Payment
CREATE TABLE 'Payment'(
  'PaymentID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  'GuestID' INTEGER NOT NULL,
  'HotelID' INTEGER NOT NULL,

## A set of scenarios with SQL queries that satisfy the business goals

### The total spend by customer for a particular stay

* The amount spent by customer during each stay is reflected in an invoice
* A guest would have only one invoice that correspond to each stay 
* An invoice is released when the amount outstanding is paid in full AND after a guest checks out
* Display the total amount spend by customer whose GuestID = 1 and InvoiceID = 1

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
SELECT 
	  c.GuestID
	, c.InvoiceID
	, SUM(c.ChargeAmount) AS TotalAmount
	, i.PaidFlag

FROM Charge AS c
INNER JOIN Invoice AS i
USING (InvoiceID)
WHERE i.InvoiceCheckOutTime IS NOT NULL
  AND c.InvoiceID = 1
GROUP BY c.InvoiceID
```

### The most valuable customers

* The most valuable customers are defined as the highest paying customers in a specific period of time
* Payments by customer and date information are stored in the PAYMENT table
* Pull the top 10 most valuable customers by the specified period

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
-- in the last two months (excluding the current month)
SELECT 
    Guest.GuestID

ORDER BY TotalValue DESC
LIMIT 10;
--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
```

### Which are the top countries where our customers come from

* Pull top 10 countries by the total number of guests

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
SELECT 
    Country
  , COUNT(GuestID) AS NumberOfGuests
FROM Guest
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(GuestID) DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### How much did the hotel pay in referral fees for each of the platforms

* Each channel provider charges a booking fee for each reservation
* A set percentage is paid on each reservation made through each platform
* The booking fee is payable at the end of each month
* It is charged only when a reservation has been used (not canceled)

### The utilization rate for each hotel in the last 12 months

* Calculate the average utilization of room bookings in each hotel
* The number of days of stays for a room represents the number of billable days
* Therefore, the average billable days of each hotel is the mean of the number 
  of billable days for all rooms in that hotel
* In the last 12 month excluding the current month

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
SELECT 
    t2.HotelID
  , AVG(t2.TotalBillableDays) AS AvgBillableDays	
FROM
	( SELECT

		, t1.RoomID
		, SUM(t1.billable_day) AS TotalBillableDays
	FROM
		( SELECT 
			  h.HotelID
			, pr.RoomID
			, CASE WHEN pr.DateFrom < DATE('now', 'start of month', '-12 month') 
				   THEN JulianDay(pr.DateTo)-Julianday(DATE('now', 'start of month', '-12 month'))
				   ELSE JulianDay(pr.DateTo)-Julianday(pr.DateFrom)
				   END billable_day

### Customer Value in terms of total spent for each customer before the current booking

* The current booking means that a guest's invoice has not been released yet 
* So, InvoiceCheckOutTime is NULL for the current bookings
* Calculate LTV by each customer based on total payments with invoice closed

```{sql, eval=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines', connection=my_connection}
SELECT 
    i.GuestID
  , g.FirstName
  , g.LastName
  , SUM(p.PayAmount) AS TotalSpend
FROM Invoice  AS i
INNER JOIN Payment AS p 
USING (InvoiceID)
INNER JOIN Guest AS g
USING (GuestID)
WHERE i.InvoiceCheckOutTime IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY i.GuestID
